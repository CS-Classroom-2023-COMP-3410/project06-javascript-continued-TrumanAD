I updated a fruit matching game from project 05. There were three new features I attempted to implement with the help of ChatGPT. Firstly, when a match was found,
I wanted to make the cards green out in an animation. This did not work after 4 attempts. Secondly, I tried Making a winning screen that allowed the user to play again. 
This failed twice because it would show up BEFORE the game had even started. Lastly, I wanted to make a 'Hint' feature that would show two possible tiles a match could be if one
tile was already turned. This never worked even after extensive attempts. I believe all three of these features are reasonable in a frontend project. It gives a smooth feel with nice animations
like a default google game (e.g. Minesweeper/Snake).
